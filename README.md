# SAAT - Statistical Arbitrage - Algorithmic Trading

## Guidance
* Create a new virtual environment (Python 3.6+) and install dependencies with 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.
* First, you need to acquire data from Bitfinex. This can be done by running 'caching_finex.py' (don't forget to input you credentials in /CONFIG/config_finex.yml).
* Second, run partial analysis of the data with 'analysis.py'. Once this is done, you'll get a file named 'Thresholds.xlsx'. Open it and look for the best thresholds for the best pairs.
* Input the settings found at the last step in 'analysis.py' at lines 494-503.
* Change parameter at line 9 to 2 and rerun 'analysis.py'. This will allow you to select the best pair possible by looking at the graphs generated.
* Input your choice in 'action.py' with the required parameters (lines 10-15).
* Run 'action.py' to start paper-trading with real-time data.
